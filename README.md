# Welcome to Extension Kit

The Unit4 Extension Kit is a toolkit for authoring and deploying new capabilities as micro-services, a cloud hosting model, and a declarative way to connect new and existing capabilities together to create new functionality. Focus is high on creating custom self driving experiences across applications.

In this documentation you will find a guide of how to create your own flows, some samples of flows using a variety of Triggers and Actions and a detailed doc of how to import to your own environment all the flows included in this repo.

For further and detailed information you can navigate to the People Platform external documentation site using this [link](https://docs-external.u4pp.com/extensions-kit/guides/portal/overview/).
